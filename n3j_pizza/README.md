Hi, this script was written by n3j / N3jkodem. It's a simple job of a pizza provider based on the ESX framework. 
Blip and marker locations are adapted to the interior: "drussalaspizza" all taskbars are "gen-taskbar" and notifications are "mythic_notify". 
If you need help translating the script, write DM Discord: n3jkodem #6727

# Installation
